# cats-vs-dogs

This project was created for learning purposes.
The objective was to:
- Explore deep learning and neural networks
- Understand the basics of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Use Keras to train a simple model that classifies images as cats or dogs
  
For a better comprehensive understanding of the architecture of convolutional neural networks, I wrote the following article: https://kheirie-elhariri.medium.com/convolutional-neural-networks-for-image-classification-c403159e81af
